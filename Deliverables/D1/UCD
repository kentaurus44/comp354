\section{Definition of Simulator}
The radar simulator is java based program which emulate the behavior of a real vessel.
the radar simulator will read the location of different type of vessel in a range of 5000 meters,
computes the location and directions of each vessels, 
sends the different informations to the vessel monitoring system ,updates every time the vessels  
change position or location  
\section{Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item reads from vsf file  
\item computes speed ,x-positioin and y-position 
\item refresh evert 2 minutes 
\item communicates with the vessel monitoring systems(VMS) 
\item sends location of vessel that are whithin 5000 meters
\item goal in context: the system request information from the Simulator 
\item primary actor: systems,vessels
\item Stakeholders and interests
 system:sends and receives vessels information 
 Sim system: computes vessels location 
 Main sucess scenario: 
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item read vessels information from vsf files 
 \item computes vessels location 
 \item sends vessels information to VMS
 \item Programming language: Java
 \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
