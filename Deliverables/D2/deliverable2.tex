\section{Introduction} % Status: Complete

This document will describe in detail the requirement specifications for the Vessel Monitoring System which is to be developed in the context of the COMP354 course. The requirements specifications include a detailed version of the architecture design pattern, a 4+1 Architectural View diagram (as well as a description of the rationale of this design), Module Interface Specifications for each subsystem, a complete description of the design of the system and of all its subsystems, full dynamic design scenarios of two substantial use cases, and a revised cost estimation and project schedule.

If a requirement appears in this document, the final Vessel Monitoring System \emph{must} conform to this requirement. Inversely, the Vessel Monitoring System is not required to conform to any other requirement that is not specified in this document.

\section{Architectural Design} % Status: See subsections

\subsection{Architecture Diagram} % Status: See subsubsections
Previously in the program, we had the main method calling the information on a timer and sending the information to the GUI. 
This approach caused the entire system (including all subsystems) to work at the same time, which was not what we wanted. 
We reworked the architecture of the program and now it is separated into several subsystems.
All of these subsystems now work independently from each other.
\subsubsection{Logical View} % Status: Complete
\begin{figure}[!htb]
\caption{Communication Diagram of the Simulator Subsystem}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{diagrams/simulator-communication-diagram.eps}
\end{figure}
When the program is started, this subsystem will start and parse the arguments that are given to it. Following that it will read from the vsf file from which it will create a simulatorConfiguration instance. With the configuration created from the vsf file, it will start the simulator.  The simulator will update all data to the connection client class at regular intervals. From there it will interact with the updateData class and the VMS subsystem.

\break
\begin{figure}[!htb]
\caption{Class Diagram of the Simulator Subsystem}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{diagrams/simulator-class-diagram.eps}
\end{figure}
These are the classes involved in the configuration process of the creation of the simulator. As stated for Figure 1, simulatorConfiguration class will take on a vsf file for it to parse, with that it will ensure that the configuration can be set properly. After this, the simulator will start the connectionClient which will enable communication with the VMS subsystem.


\begin{figure}[!htb]	
\caption{Class Diagram of the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) Subsystem}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{diagrams/vms-class-diagram.eps}
\end{figure}
These are the classes involved to update the data for the graphical interface. The RadarGUI class is where the user can see the output and is updated through the RadarMonitor.Observer.
The RadarMonitor.Observer is updated by the RadarMonitor from there it will get the data from ConnectionServer.Observer.

\break
\begin{figure}[!htb]
\caption{Communication Diagram of the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) Subsystem}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{diagrams/vms-communication-diagram.eps}
\end{figure}
When the program is started, the client will send a JSON update via the socket it will have created to the connection server class. From that point on, it will start communicating with the updateData class for new information. If any data was updated it will notify the observers that the data has been changed, and in doing so, the radar monitor data will be updated. Inside the radar monitor it will search for any data that requires attention (e.g. alerts). If any need attention, it will notify the observers (RadarGUI) with the list of alerts.

\subsubsection{Process View} % Status: Complete

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\caption{Activity Diagram for the Simulator Subsystem}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{diagrams/simulator-acitivity-diagram.eps}
\end{figure}
The simulator has two main functionality: validating input from user and initializing/updating the data. 
The first step is to validate the parameters given from the user, it will check if the host, port and the .vsf file. 
If anything fails in step one the program will exit and wait for the user to input the next command line.
Then step two happens, it will start the simulator use the data received and send it to the connection client.
Connection client will serialize the data to update data and will keep looping around till the program terminates.

\break
\begin{figure}[!htb]

\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{diagrams/vms-activity-diagram.eps}
\end{figure}
The Vessel Monitoring System has two main functionality: connecting to server and updating the graphical user interface with the data.
The first step is to connect to then server, in this step the user will be connected via socket to the server.
If it fails it will simply return to the start.
Then step two happens, the connection server will request data from update data. If new data was found it will send it to the radar monitor.
Then when the radar monitor receives the new data it will check if any alert were triggered and update the graphical user interface.

\subsubsection{Developement View} % Status: Work in Progress
\begin{figure}[!htb]
\caption{Component Diagram of the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS)}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{diagrams/vms-component-diagram.eps}
\end{figure}
In the Vessel Monitoring System, the RadarMonitor is the core of this subsystem.
The information of the server is recorded in RadarMonitor.
It also updates the information that is sent to the user interface.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\caption{Component Diagram of the Simulator}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{diagrams/simulator-component-diagram.eps}
\end{figure}
In the Simulator subsystem, the simulator itself is the core.
From the simulator, it goes ahead and create an instance of SimulatorConfiguration and ConnectionClient.
With those in hand, it will be able to start the simulation.

\section{Detailed Design} % Status: Complete

In this section, we will describe in detail each subsystem of the software.

\subsection{Subsystems} % Status: Complete

\subsubsection{Detailed Design Diagram} % Status: Complete

\paragraph{Simulator Subsystem} 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\caption{Simulator Class Diagram}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{diagrams/simulator-class-diagram.eps}
\end{figure}

The Simulator subsystem is the part of the software that will simulate the actual physical radar and the data it sends to the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS). A .vsf file, which lists the positions and courses of given vessels, as well as various configuration parameters for the VMS, is parsed and interpreted as vessel data by the simulator, which then establishes socket communication with the VMS. The simulator then proceeds to send updated data to the VMS at set intervals, until the pre-defined total time limit expires.

\break

\paragraph{Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) Subsystem}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\caption{VMS Class Diagram}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{diagrams/vms-class-diagram.eps}
\end{figure}

The Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) subsystem is the part of the software that will receive vessel data from the radar (represented by the Simulator) and interpret this data so that it can be viewed by the user via a graphical interface, and emit high- or low-risk alerts if any two vessels are within a certain range of each other. The VMS accepts socket connections from any number of Simulator instances.

\section{Dynamic Design Scenarios} % Status: Complete

In this section, we introduce two possible scenarios (use cases) which show interactions between the software and external users. In addition, we show how components of the software interact, within each subsystem.

\section{Revised Cost Estimation} % Status: Complete

\subsection{Cost Estimates}

\begin{description}
  \item[Simulator program:] \$150, cost to code and implement.
  \item[VMS program:] \$150, cost to code and implement.
  \item[Graphical User Interface:] \$100, cost to design, code, and implement.
  \item[Unit test suite:] \$25, cost to write test cases and perform testing.
  \item[Total Cost:] \$425
\end{description}

\paragraph{Basis} Costs have been calculated based on the amount of man hours spent working on project (at a low approximate labor cost of \$5 an hour), as well as a reduced cost of tools used to produce code, test cases, documentation, and diagrams.
Re-estimation of costs may occur when any of the above artifacts is complete, based on whether the artifact took less time or more time than we originally anticipated.

\subsection{Project Schedule}

\begin{description}
  \item[Simulator program:] 8 hours of coding. Due date: August 1st, 2013.
  \item[VMS program:] 8 hours of coding. Due date: August 1st, 2013.
  \item[Graphical User Interface:] 4 hours of coding. Due date: August 7th, 2013.
  \item[Unit test suite:] 2 hour of testing. Due date: August 9th, 2013.
  \item[Final integration:] 4 hours of implementation. Due date: August 12th, 2013.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Note}
The times listed to complete the Simulator program, VMS program, and Graphical User Interface are estimations of how much time the \emph{remainder} of the coding will take, not accounting for the time that has already been spent on the programs as they currently are.

\subsection{Risk}

	All due dates have been calculated with a buffer zone in mind to account for lack of availability depending on course load. Still, course load is difficult to predict, therefore there is a risk that some of the team members will not be able to produce their assigned artifact in time.

Also, writing test cases in parallel with the rest of the software may slightly delay production, although the reliability of the code will be improved.

All cost estimates and due dates are subject to change.
