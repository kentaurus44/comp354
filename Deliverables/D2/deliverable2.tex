\section{Introduction} % Status: To be done

This document will describe in detail the requirement specifications for the Vessel Monitoring System which is to be developed in the context of the COMP354 course. The requirements specifications include ... 

If a requirement appears in this document, the final Vessel Monitoring System \emph{must} conform to this requirement. Inversely, the Vessel Monitoring System is not required to conform to any other requirement that is not specified in this document.

\section{Architectural Design} % Status: To be done

\subsection{Architecture Diagram}

\subsubsection{Logical View}

The program as it is communicates in a completely different way that it previously does. Previously we had the main calling the information on a timer and sending them to the GUI which was making the program working all at the same time which was not what we wanted. The program now is separated into two subsystems; the VMS and simulator package working in parallel.

The simulator is in charge of making sure that the configuration is properly set into the sockets. Following the validation, the simulator will send the updated values at regular intervals to the VMS package.

The VMS package uses the observer pattern. The radar monitor and radar GUI are both observers of the server, so every time that the server is updated the monitor/GUI are also at the same time.

\subsection{Subsystem Interfaces Specifications}

\subsubsection{Simulator Package}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Parse command line from user: 
		\newline "./Simulator --host 192.168.0.1 --port 1024 --input filename.vsf"
		\newline Note: --host, --port and --input can be replaced with -h -p -i respectively.
		\newline The order of the of the arguments must be in this order.
  \item In the main function, the command line above will go through validation.
  \item When all cleared: "SimulatorConfiguration.parseVSF(InputStream in)"
		\newline which will return the config instance.
  \item File will be closed.
	\item "ConnectionClient.connect(String host, int port) throws IOException" will take the validated host and port from the command and create a new socket for the user.
	\item "" Not sure how it works here.
	\item "Simulator.start(ConnectionClient client)" will take the client instance created at step 5 and use it to start the simulator.	
\end{enumerate}

\section{Detailed Design} % Status: To be done

\subsection{Subsystems} 

\subsubsection{Detailed Design Diagram}

[UML class diagram or equivalent depicting the internal structure of the subsystems, accompanied by a paragraph of text describing the rationale of the designs.]

\subsubsection{Unit Descriptions}

[List each class in the subsystem and write a short description of its purpose, as well as notes or reminders useful for the programmers who will implement them. List all attributes and functions of the class.]

\section{Dynamic Design Scenarios} % Status: To be done

[Give a full dynamic design of two substantial use cases including system sequence diagrams operational contracts, and sequence diagrams. Units and subsystems depicted here must be compatible with the descriptions provided in section 2 and 3.]

\section{Revised Cost Estimation} % Status: To be done

[Provide a revised estimated cost and schedule for the project, as well as the basis for those estimates, and the points and circumstances in the project when re-estimation might occur.Evaluate the cost of production of each artifact, as described in the previous section, and then adding up the numbers.]
