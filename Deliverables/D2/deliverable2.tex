\section{Introduction} % Status: Complete

This document will describe in detail the requirement specifications for the Vessel Monitoring System which is to be developed in the context of the COMP354 course. The requirements specifications include a detailed version of the architecture design pattern, a 4+1 Architectural View diagram as well as a description of the rationale of this design, Module Interface Specifications for each subsystem, a complete description of the design of the system and of all its subsystems, full dynamic design scenarios of two substantial use cases, and a revised cost estimation and project schedule.

If a requirement appears in this document, the final Vessel Monitoring System \emph{must} conform to this requirement. Inversely, the Vessel Monitoring System is not required to conform to any other requirement that is not specified in this document.

\section{Architectural Design} % Status: To be done

\subsection{Architecture Diagram}

\subsubsection{Logical View}

The program as it is communicates in a completely different way that it previously does. Previously we had the main calling the information on a timer and sending them to the GUI which was making the program working all at the same time which was not what we wanted. The program now is separated into two subsystems; the VMS and simulator package working in parallel.

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{diagrams/simulator-class-diagram.eps}
\end{figure}

\vspace{1cm}

When the simulator is running, it only interact with two other class to ensure that all the configuration is properly set. (Figure 1)

\end{figure}

The simulator is in charge of making sure that the configuration is properly set into the sockets. Following the validation, the simulator will send the updated values at regular intervals to the VMS package.
(Figure 2)

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

The VMS package uses the observer pattern. The radar monitor and radar GUI are both observers of the server, so every time that the server is updated the monitor/GUI are also at the same time.
(Figure 4)

\subsubsection{Development View}

\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{diagrams/activity-diagram.eps}
\end{figure}

\vspace{1cm}

In the development side, the simulator package is where the most heavy lifting for the program to start moving forward. 
But once all the parsing and validation is complete the program should update the data then update the interface of the user at some interval.
(Figure 5)

\break

\subsection{Subsystem Interfaces Specifications}

\subsubsection{Simulator Package}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Parse command line from user: 
		\newline "./Simulator --host 192.168.0.1 --port 1024 --input filename.vsf"
		\newline Note: --host, --port and --input can be replaced with -h -p -i respectively.
		\newline The order of the of the arguments must be in this order.
  \item In the main function, it will ensure that the command line is writen like above otherwise will exit the system.
  \item When all cleared: "SimulatorConfiguration.parseVSF(InputStream in)"
		\newline which will return the configuration instance of the simulator.
  \item Any files opened at the time will be closed to ensure no unessessary stream is open.
	\item "ConnectionClient.connect(String host, int port) throws IOException" will take the validated host and port from the command and create a new socket for the user.
	\item "Simulator.start(ConnectionClient client)" will take the client instance created at step 5 and use it to start the simulator.	
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{VMS Package}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item ConnectionServer.bind(SocketAddress addr) throws IOException
	\item ConnectionServer.start() throws IOException
\end{enumerate}


\section{Detailed Design}

\subsection{Subsystems}

\subsubsection{Detailed Design Diagram}

\paragraph{Simulator Subsystem}

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Simulator Class Diagram}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{diagrams/simulator-class-diagram.eps}
\end{figure}

The Simulator subsystem is the part of the software that will simulate the actual physical radar and the data it sends to the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS). A .vsf file, which lists the positions and courses of given vessels, as well as various configuration parameters for the VMS, is parsed and interpreted as vessel data by the simulator, which then establishes socket communication with the VMS. The simulator then proceeds to send updated data to the VMS at set intervals, until the pre-defined total time limit expires.

\paragraph{Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) Subsystem}

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Simulator Class Diagram}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{diagrams/vms-class-diagram.eps}
\end{figure}

The Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) subsystem is the part of the software that will receive vessel data from the radar (represented by the Simulator) and interpret this data so that it can be viewed by the user via a graphical interface, and emit high- or low-risk alerts if any two vessels are within a certain range of each other. The VMS accepts socket connections from any number of Simulator instances.

\subsubsection{Unit Descriptions}

\paragraph{Simulator Subsystem}

\subparagraph{Class SimulatorConfiguration}
The main purpose of this class is to parse .vsf file and to keep track of the data obtained, as well as registering any modifications to this data.

Attributes:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item private int \_StartDelay
    \item private int \_TimeInterval
    \item private int \_TotalTime
    \item private int \_RadarRange
    \item List\textless Vessel\textgreater \, \_Vessels
\end {enumerate}

Functions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item private SimulatorConfiguration()
	\item public int getStartDelay()
	\item public void setStartDelay(int)
	\item public int getTimeInterval()
	\item public void setTimeInterval(int)
	\item public int getTotalTime()
	\item public void setTotalTime(int)
	\item public int getRadarRange()
	\item public void setRadarRange(int)
	\item public List\textless Vessel\textgreater  \,getVessels()
	\item public void addVessel(Vessel)
	\item public static SimulatorConfiguration parseVSF(InputStream)
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Class ConnectionClient}
This class is responsible for establishing and managing the socket connection to the VMS, as well as sending all update data via this connection. The sent data is converted to JSON and encoded as Netstring.

Attributes:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item private final int TIMEOUT
    \item private Socket \_Socket
\end {enumerate}

Functions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item public ConnectionClient()

	\item private static long DEFAULT\_REFRESH
    \item private boolean \_Continue
    \item private long \_RefreshTime
