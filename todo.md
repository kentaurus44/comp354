To Do List
=======
## COMP354 Team Project

### Coding

* Add scale for map view
* Add option to hide/show warning circles all the time
* Make ID number (or vessel info) display on hover instead of all the time
* Make map view prettier (perhaps blueish or greenish background to simulate water or radar)
* Make map circular (instead of square/rectangular)
* Make zoom function zoom closer and make it moveable
* Add a way to differentiate between different vessels with same ID from different VSF files
* Create easy way to add VSF files to system (browse for file) instead of command line invocation
* Make vessels arrows/triangles instead of dots (to show direction)

#### Note:
Some of the items listed above are optional (they may or may not be implemented in the final version)

### Documentation

* Finish Sections 2 (except 2.2.1) and 3 of Deliverable 3
